Server will start processing the changes and new content, and you'll receive an email confirmation when the channel is published:

Once you receive the confirmation by email, you can share the published channel with administrators at your facilities or the whole world: just copy the channel ID/token and send it to them by email.

.. tip:: Remember to re-publish the channel each time you make changes or updates to content items. The channel ID/token remains the same but administrators will need to import it again into Kolibri, in order to make the changes and see the new content available on the devices in their facilities.
